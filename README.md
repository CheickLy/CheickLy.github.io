👋🏾 Hey, I’m Cheick Ly

Aspiring Software Engineer • CS @ Loyola University Maryland • Tech Enthusiast

I love using technology to solve real-world problems, and actually have fun doing it.
I got into coding from a childhood love of games, which grew into curiosity about mods, exploits, and how systems actually work under the hood. Now I build real software, learn new tools fast, and ship projects that help people.
